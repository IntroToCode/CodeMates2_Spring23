## Servings: 
2

## Time to prepare: 
30 minutes

## Ingredients:
- 1 1"-thick New York strip steak (about 13 oz.)
- 2 tbsp. vegetable oil, divided
- 1 tsp. Kosher salt, plus more for seasoning to taste
- 1 tsp. Freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning to taste
- 3/4 tsp. smoked paprika, plus more for seasoning to taste
- 2 tbsp. butter
- 4 eggs
- Roasted potatoes, for serving
- Parsley, for serving
- Dill, for serving

## Equipment needed:
- Cast Iron Skillet
- Measuring Spoons 
- Meat Thermometer 
- Cutting Board
- Knife

## Steps for preparation:
###Step 1
Remove steak from refrigerator and let come to room temperature, 30 minutes. 
###Step 2
Rub steak with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and season all over with 1 ½ teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and ¾ teaspoon paprika.
###Step 3
Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook, flipping once, until a deep golden crust begins to form on both sides of the steak, about 5 minutes total. 
###Step 4
Reduce heat to medium-low and add butter to pan. Using a kitchen towel, carefully grip the skillet handle and tilt towards you so that the melting butter forms a pool at the bottom of the skillet. Using a spoon, continually baste butter onto steak to form a deeper golden crust. Flip steak and repeat, 2 to 3 minutes in total. Using a meat thermometer, check for doneness: 120-125°F  for medium rare, 130°F for medium. 
###Step 5
Transfer steak onto a cutting board and let rest about 10 minutes. 
###Step 6
Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Crack egg into pan and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until white is set and edges are just beginning to brown. Remove from pan and season with salt and pepper.
###Step 7
Slice steak into 1" strips on a bias, against the grain. 
###Step 8
Serve steak with eggs and potatoes. Garnish with herbs and season with more salt, pepper, and paprika to taste.
